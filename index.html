            <h2>WHO AM I</h2>
            <p>Hello. I'm Khayal, a passionate and motivated learner with a strong interest in technology, programming, and creativity. I enjoy exploring new skills and bringing ideas to life through coding and design. I have experience with languages like C++ and Python, and I'm currently working on web projects using HTML and CSS. In addition to my technical interests, I'm also drawn to art, music, and science fiction films like Interstellar and Arrival. I believe in continuous learning and always strive to improve myself both personally and professionally. Whether it's building a project, solving a problem, or learning something new, I approach every challenge with curiosity and determination.</p>

                <h3>Spinner Loading Bar</h3>
                <p>
                    This was a small but meaningful project where I built a loading animation using only HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a simple, smooth spinner that could be used as a loading indicator on websites or web apps. <br>
                    Key features: <br>
                    Fully created with HTML and CSS (no JavaScript) <br>
                    Used @keyframes for smooth rotation <br>
                    Practiced using transform, border, and animation timing <br>
                    What I learned: <br>
                    This project improved my understanding of CSS animations, timing functions, and visual optimization for UI elements.

                <h3>FC Barcelona Fan Page Website</h3>
                <p>This project was inspired by my passion for football and especially FC Barcelona. I designed and coded a full fan page website that includes multiple sections to reflect the spirit of the club.<br>
                    Key sections of the website:<br>
                    Homepage with the club's logo and welcome message,<br>
                    Club history and achievements,<br>
                    A list of legendary players (with images),<br>
                    Match highlights and upcoming fixtures,<br>
                    Photo gallery section.<br>
                    Technologies used: HTML, CSS<br>
                    What I learned:<br>
                    I improved my ability to organize content in a clean structure, apply responsive styling, and match visual themes to a brand. It also helped me build a full multi-section static website from scratch.

                <h3>Landscape</h3>
                <p>
                    In this project, I designed a clean and visually appealing sunny landscape using only HTML and CSS. The goal was to create a simple yet effective vector-style illustration featuring key visual elements such as the sun, clouds, grass, and sky—all styled purely with CSS.<br>
                    Technologies used:<br>
                    HTML5 – for structure<br>
                    CSS3 – for visual styling and layout<br>
                    This project showcases my ability to use CSS creatively to design custom shapes and build engaging visual compositions without relying on images or JavaScript.

                <h3>3D Card</h3>
                <p>
                    Take a look at this engaging flippable card I designed as part of my portfolio! Using HTML and CSS, I created a dynamic card that flips seamlessly when you hover over it, revealing a fresh design on the back. This project highlights my ability to craft interactive and visually appealing web elements. I aimed to blend creativity with functionality, ensuring the card not only looks modern with its gradient colors but also provides a smooth user experience. Hover over the card to see the flip effect in action and explore how I bring ideas to life through code!
